## 📈 What I’m Currently Doing

- Polishing and publishing Unity demo projects from my training.
- Learning more about:
  - mobile optimization,
  - better code architecture (events, ScriptableObjects, patterns),
  - monetization (AdMob, IAP), and
  - juiciness (feel, feedback, VFX, SFX).
- Actively looking for **remote Junior / Trainee Unity Developer** opportunities.
